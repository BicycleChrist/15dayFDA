Gather the biotech data set via upcomingevents.py, or enter the ticker you want to gather price data for in tickerslist.txt, and then set use_file to true and use_events to false. 
Setting both to true will result in a dataframe combined for all tickers gathered from upcomingevents and the tickers in the .txt file. 
Once the dataframe is gathered, run Volanalysis.py to view results.
